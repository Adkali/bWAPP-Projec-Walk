bWAPP - iFrame Injection // - Medium
---------------------------
Note: The Low lvl is not so hard because you can inject everything you want by
changing the ParamUrl to some other phisi site or code, and by that manipulate the victim.
----------------------------------------

Medium:

When selecting the iFrame Injection, a 'robots.txt' page apeears to us.
For those who doesn't know, this page contains pages that wont be found by the searching engine.
When admin puts pages inside this document, he basiclly telling the searching engines that won't
show results containing the path directories of what ever puts inside this 'robots.txt'
Why is that? from security reasons, but it is a flow because when entering this, we can see which pages
the admin want to hide from us, and we as the attacker know that something important hide over there.


Now, as the name of this page, i guess we need to inject an iframe tag inside this page.
let's begin whith a little tag, and see what we get from doing it:

Code: Take the original path, and try changing the ParamWidth/Paramheight values, and the results are
we can choose which value will be set to them. Also, try changing the ParamUrl to something let's say the
name of this page, which is iframei.php, and we can see nothing appears on the current page we are in it.

Now, can we inject some html tags inside?
Let's write the next line:
Code: "><iframe src="iframei.php"</iframe>

Now, because the ParamWidth is the last, we make the inject at this parameter.
As you can see, we manage to broke code, but something went wrong.
entring the source, reavels us what heppened.
How can it be fix? we have to bypass the source code because nothing filters our injected strings.
When we send it to the page, we can manipulate it to think the code is actually part of the real one.

Let's try and fix the code:
Try the next Code: "></iframe><iframe src="iframei.php"></iframe><!--
As you can see, by entering the source, we are telling the page to ignore everything else,
and we take care of closing the iframe tag with the "</iframe>.
After that, we write our own code, and after that finish with the '<!--', which tell it that
everything else is just a comment, so ignore it.
*Note: When does, notice when making " " inside the iframe src. it adds double \ \, and nothing founds.
by removing them, we actually puts an ifarame tag inside the current page.
Code: "></iframe><iframe src=iframei.php</iframe><!--


Lets try inject some script inside it.
Code: "></iframe><script>alert("Hello-World")</script><!---
Nothing, why?
try bypass the \ \ by making double ` ` instead of " " of ' '. Success!
-------------------------

When attacker manage injecting iframe inside a web, he can manipulate a victim
to click on it, and actually make him believe the iframe is part of the web.
when the victim does, the attacker can pull he's sensetive information by triggering the
victim to make an action, which he believes (Victim) the action he made
came from the real site, when it doesn't.

Thanks for watching :)
